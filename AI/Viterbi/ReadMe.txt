The program should work but i cant get it to even print, the original read me from the class i was in
says it works slow but i was running it on the school servers and not my personal machine so that could
be part of the issue (missing certain dependancies or maybe vscode does not like to output the txt files)

The program would take the jumbled text and decode it based on the frequency of every letter in
the english alphabet and using those probabilities to determine what would be the correct sentence.
The txt files included show the progression, I had to run the program twice for the text to be completely
decoded
